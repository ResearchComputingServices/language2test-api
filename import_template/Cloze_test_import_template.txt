The King and the Navigators.
*In* 1498 Vasco da Gama, a famous n*avigator* from Portugal, went to Asia *by* ship. He and his men w*ere* the first people from the w*est* in India. They came home w*ith* many interesting things from that c*ountry*.
The king of Portugal, Manuel I, *was* very happy with the things f*rom* India. He said, "I am g*oing* to send a lot of P*ortuguese* ships to this new land." *He* looked for a navigator for *a* new voyage. The navigator's name *was* Pedr' Alvares Cabral.
"Pedr'Alvares," said *the* king, "I am sending you *to* India with thirteen ships and 1,400 men. It is a long *and* dangerous voyage. Bring me interesting t*hings* from India. And find new l*and* for Portugal, too." Captain Cabral *and* his men worked on the s*hips* for months. They wanted to s*tart* their voyage early in March, 1500. In his office, the n*avigator* looked at an old map. T*here* was a land to the w*est* of Africa, across the Atlantic O*cean*. The name of the land *was* "Terra Papagalis," the land of *the* parrots. Pedr' Alvares wanted this l*and* for Portugal.
A Drink, a Fight, *and* a New Life.
"Silvia, I *am* going to the bar. Vicente *and* Marcos are going to be there," A*fonso* Ribeiro said.
"OK, Afonso. Don't *be* late, my love," Silvia said.
A*fonso* walked to the bar near *his* house and had a drink w*ith* his friends. They were happy y*oung* men.
They liked their town, t*heir* friends, and their families.

Afonso l*oved* Silvia and their three children. *He* worked for them every day.
"It's l*ate*. Good night, my friends," Afonso s*aid* to Vicente and Marcos.
Suddenly t*here* was a lot of noise. T*here* were five men with bottles *and* knives at the back of *the* room.
They started to fight w*ith* the men near them.
"Let's *go-now*!"Vicente said.
The three friends w*ent* quickly to the door, but *a* man hit Afonso. It was *not* Afonso's fight, but he did *not* think. There was a bottle *on* a table, and he hit *the* man on the head with *it*. The man was on the f*loor* - he was dead.
The p*eople* in the bar said, "Afonso R*ibeiro* did this.
He hit this *man*." The police said, "Afonso Ribeiro, *you* cannot live in this town *now*.You are going on a s*hip* to India.You are going to l*ive* there." March 8 was a beautiful Sunday in L*isbon*. The sun was hot, and *the* river was green and quiet. T*here* were many people near the r*iver*. They wanted to see the *big* ships and the king. Manuel *I* was there because this was *an* important day for Portugal. There *was* music and dancing. Little children p*layed* with their friends.
But some p*eople* were very unhappy on this b*eautiful* Sunday morning. Afonso and Silvia R*ibeiro* went to Lisbon with their t*hree* small children. The voyage to I*ndia* was important for their country, *but* it was an unhappy voyage *for* the Ribeiro family.
"Father, when *are* you going to come home?" *Afonso's* daughter asked.


The man was *on* the floor - he was d*ead*.

"My child, I do not know," A*fonso* said.
"But father, the ocean *is* big. Can you find us a*gain*?" one of the little b*oys* asked.
"Yes, my son, I *can* find you. And, remember, I l*ove* you. Be good for your m*other* and think about me every night," A*fonso* said. Silvia looked at Afonso *and* cried.
Afonso went on a s*hip*. He called goodbye to Silvia *and* to his children. Slowly, the s*hip* went down the Tejo River *to* the ocean. The people, the noise, *and* the town were behind him *now*. A new life waited for A*fonso* Ribeiro. He said quietly, "I *am* going to see my family a*gain* one day."
Life on the C*aravel* Afonso Ribeiro walked onto one *of* the king's ships on March 8, 1500. He was twenty:"'five years *old*. It was his first voyage *on* the ocean. He said, "Every *day* I am going to write a*bout* my new life." March 8: I alp on a c*aravel* in the Atlantic Ocean.
Where *are* we going? Why is this *an* important voyage for Portugal? I *am* very unhappy. I look at *the* ocean and think about my h*ome*. I want to be with S*ilvia* and my children.
March 15: Today an interesting old *man* talked to me.
He writes a*bout* the caravel and the voyage *in* a big book. This morning *he* said, "You are a writer, *too*. What is your name? Why *are* you here? What is in y*our* book?" We talked about my s*tory*. Then he talked about famous n*avigators* and their ocean voyages. His n*ame* is   "You are a writer, *too*."

Pero Vaz. He is *a* good teacher and an interesting *man*.
Now I understand about our v*oyage* to India.
March 20: The thirteen caravels went s*outh* from Lisbon, near Madeira and *the* Canaries. The wind is usually good, *and* we are moving quickly.
One *day* our captain, Pedr' Alvares Cabral, said, "We *are* not going to go south. *We* are going to go west a*cross* the ocean. We are going *to* make a voyage to a *new* land." "Where are we going?" *the* men asked.
"I do not w*ant* to see India. That is V*asco* da Gama's land. I want *to* find Terra Papagalis. I am g*oing* to find this land for *our* king," Cabral said..
Across the A*tlantic* Ocean? A new land? Does *my* family remember me? Am I g*oing* to see Portugal again one *day*?
March 23: In the night there w*ere* strong winds and heavy rain. *It* was a dangerous time. One ship, w*ith* 140 men, went down under the w*ater*. The rain stopped in the morning, *and* we looked for the men. *We* did not find them. They *are* all dead now. They are *not* going to see their families *in* Portugal again. This is a d*ifficult* life for us.
April 3: There are a lot *of* men and boys on the t*hirteen* caravels. There are about 100 people on our ship, but *no* women. Our life is very d*ifficult*. We get up early and w*ork* all day. Every man and *boy* has a job.
The boys *are* strong. They do the heavy w*ork*.
The food i's not very good, *and* we only have a little w*ater*. We can drink the water, *but* we cannot wash. A lot *of* the men get sick because t*hey* cannot wash.
There is a d*octor* on the caravel, but he d*oes* not understand every problem on *the* ship.


"We are going to m*ake* a voyage to a new l*and*."

Land!
The twelve carave1s moved across the Atlantic O*cean* for forty-four days. Early in *the* morning of April 22, a man cal1ed, "Look! Birds! We are n*ear* land!" "Is it India?" Afonso a*sked* Pero Vaz.
"No," the old *man* answered. "It is a new l*and* for us.
It is on *Cabral's* map. Remember, we went west f*rom* Europe." The caravels stopped in *the* water, and the men looked *at* the land. They saw white b*eaches* and tall green trees.
In *the* morning, a small boat went *to* the land.
"Afonso," the captain said, "you *go* with these men in the b*oat*." Afonso and six men a*rrived* on the beach. They were *in* a beautiful green place.. Suddenly, t*here* was a lot of noise.
"What *is* that?" Afonso asked.
"Look in *the* trees. Big parrots live in t*his* land. This is Terra Papagalis," *one* man said.
Men, women, and c*hildren* came onto the beach.
Two i*mportant* men from Terra Papagalis went w*ith* Afonso and the six men *to* the ship. Their names were U*ira* and Raoni. They had gifts *for* the captain. He wanted to t*alk* to them, but they did *not* understand him. He had gifts *for* them, too.
After two weeks *in* the new land, a caravel w*ent* back to Portugal with a l*etter* to Manuel I.
To Manuel I, K*ing* of Portugal From Pedr'Alvares Cabral, *His* Navigator This letter brings a h*appy* story to my king and *my* country. Your   Two important men f*rom* Terra Papagalis went with Alfonso *and* the six men to the s*hip*.

caravels did not go to I*ndia*. We went west because we w*anted* to find new lands for P*ortugal*. We arrived in Terra Papagalis. *It* is a big country and *the* Tupiniquin people are friendly.
These p*eople* are strong and have long b*lack* hair. Terra Papagalis is a *hot* country, and the people do *not* have shoes or shirts or dresses, *but* they have a lot of g*ood* things. I am sending you g*ifts* from Uira and Raoni. They *are* important Tupiniquin men. They visited *one* of our caravels. We cannot t*alk* to them in Portuguese, but *we* talk with our hands and f*aces*. They are good men and *do* not want to fight with *us*. I am not coming back *to* Portugal now. I am going *to* India with eleven of your c*aravels*. I want to find land there, too, *for* you, my king.
Life with *the* Tupiniquins.
May 6: The caravels went away f*rom* Terra Papagalis today, but I *am* staying here. I watched the s*hips* and I cried. Uira and R*aoni* looked at me and cried, *too*.
They are my friends, but *I* want to be with the *men* on the caravels. I want *to* go home. This is an u*nhappy* day for me.
July 30: I can talk to *the* Tupiniquins now. I know many t*hings* about their lives. They are *a* people of the Tupi-Guarani family. T*hey* often move to a new p*lace* because they look for animals *for* food. Then they build houses *in* the new place. In one f*amily* there are sometimes many children *and* mothers, but there is only *one* father.
August 7: My life with the T*upiniquins* is very good.
We are *one* big family. I am teaching *the* children the   My life with *the* Tupiniquins is very good.

names *of* animals and fruit in Portuguese. T*hey* can say "hello" and "goodbye," *too*.
I work with the men e*very* day. It is hot in *the* afternoon, and then we swim *in* the river. At night we p*lay* music and dance.
I have *a* house, food, and many friends. *I* live in a beautitll1 place with good people. But *I* am not happy.
The Tupiniquins *are* not my people. This place *is* not my town. I think a*bout* Silvia and my children every *day*. Do they remember me? When *can* I go home?
Home Again.
E*arly* one morning, after two years *in* Terra Papagalis, Afonso walked on *the* beach with Raoni and Uira.
T*hey* talked and looked for animals. Suddenly, A*fonso* stopped and looked at the o*cean*.
"What is that?" he said *to* Raoni and Uira. "Look!" "It *is* a big ship," Raoni answered. "Is *it* a ship from your country'?" *The* ship came near the beach. "It *is* a caravel! Maybe it is f*rom* Portugal. Maybe I can go h*ome* with them," Afonso said.
After s*ome* time, a small boat came *to* the beach with four men. "Hello," A*fonso* said. "My name is Afonso R*ibeiro*. I came here with Captain *Pedr'Alvares* Cabral's ships. I am from *a* small town in Portugal" The *men* talked to Afonso in Portuguese, *and* he was very happy.
Afonso w*ent* to the caravel with the f*our* Portuguese men and talked to *the* ship's navigator. His name was A*merigo* Vespucci. He was from Florence, *in* Italy. But   "It is a c*aravel*! Maybe it is from Portugal."

*he* worked for Manuel I of Portugal, *and* his men were Portuguese. Amerigo *had* a lot of questions for Afonso:
"How *is* the land?" "Who lives h*ere*?" "Do the people have b*oats*?""Are they friendly?" Afonso answered C*aptain* Vespucci's questions and talked about *his* life with the Tupiniquins. But *he* had one important question for *the* navigator.
"Please can I go w*ith* you back to Portugal?" Afonso a*sked*. "I want to go home." "Yes, Afonso," V*espucci* said. "Your king is going *to* be happy with you now. *The* story of your life here *is* very important." In the morning, A*merigo* Vespucci went to Terra Papagalis w*ith* Afonso. The navigator visited the T*upiniquins* and went into their houses. *He* had gifts for them from *the* king of Portugal. In the evening, *the* people played music and danced *for* the navigator.
Later, Afonso said g*oodbye*. He looked at Uira and R*aoni* and smiled. "Thank you. You *are* good friends." Then Afonso and *the* Tupiniquins cried.
..
Afonso finished his s*tory* at home in Portugal.
June 10, 1502: Today I visited Manuel *I*. The king said, "Afonso Ribeiro, *you* are an important person. I w*ant* to know about Terra Papagalis." *I* talked to the king for *a* long time about the land, *the* people, the trees, the fruit. . .
*The* king said, "Afonso, you know *a* lot of things about this p*lace*! Thank you for your story. *Now* you have a new job. T*each* my navigators about this new l*and*!"

December 15, 1502: Now I have a *big* house and a lot of m*oney*. I do an important job *for* the king, and I am h*appy* with my family. Silvia is g*oing* to have a child in *the* new year. I see my c*hildren* every morning and every night.. *But* sometimes I think about the Tupiniquins, *too*. Where are Raoni and Uira *now*?
Am I going to go b*ack* to Terra Papagalis one day?
